Requests: 
 
Marcin left me XEF calibration to do, which entails QIE I guess 
(no recent log file.) 
 
Abraham has requested a quick cosmics run >> YMon. 
 
Checking PCAL 05 with a shower max calibration sometime before the plug sourcing @ 2100.

New run with FCAL00 and FCAL01 crates. The events were taken  
using zerobias trigger and hardEvb. It works and the  
bank structure for the MPAD looks fine.

<pre>At or about 4:30 pm today November 12, a change was made to the 
access control list for online subnet 236a (the lower half of 
subnet 236). This change blocked some operations between 
online and onsite offline computers (such as offline database). 
 
I asked for the ACL to be turned off until Tuesday morning.

<pre>Completed commissioning of BMU trigger path into muon 
matchbox cards.  From this point forward, BMU trigger  
primitives will be read out as part of TCMD bank. 
 
Identified three bad cards in the process of debugging 
BMU trigger links.   
 
(1) removed tdc #382 from IMU01 slot 20.  Replaced with 
    board #374 
 
(2) removed bad muon TDC transition module (B-29) from  
    IMU01 slot 11 
 
(3) removed bad matchbox transition module (MBT-16) from 
    MUTR00 slot 11 </pre>

So the real S.K. run is this one (131781); probably won't get 
30K events before they finish roping off for the plug sourcing.

Rick asked for a spike run during the plug sourcing, so, this one has NO pcal crates.   
 
 
Meanwhile, heartbeat alarms predicted from PSM, we'll ignore.

finally psm heartbeat alarm.
<!-- Comment: Mon Nov 12 23;22;41 comment by...ath -->
Spike run 131783 got 30K events; 

Note that for the run configuration to validate, one must change the version of trigger_table_sumet_5 to [1,186] (default [1,143].)
