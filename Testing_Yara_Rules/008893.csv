"b All scheduled and nonscheduled service operating under 14 CFR 121. Since March 20, 1997, 14 CFR 121 includes only aircraft with 10 or more seats formerly operated under 14 CFR 135. This change makes it difficult to compare pre-1997 data for 14 CFR 121 and 14 CFR 135  with more recent years' data. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c All scheduled service operating under 14 CFR 135 (commuter air carriers). Before March 20, 1997, 14 CFR 135 applied to aircraft with 30 or fewer seats. Since March 20, 1997, 14 CFR 135 includes only aircraft with fewer than 10 seats. This change makes it difficult to compare pre-1997 data for 14 CFR 121 and 14 CFR 135  with more recent years' data. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d Nonscheduled service operating under 14 CFR 135 (on-demand air taxis).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e All operations other than those operating under 14 CFR 121 and 14 CFR 135.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"f Large trucks are defined as trucks over 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating, including single-unit trucks and truck tractors. Light trucks are defined as trucks of 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating or less, including pickups, vans, truck-based station wagons, and utility vehicles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
g Includes occupants of other unknown vehicle types and other nonmotorists.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"h Includes Amtrak. Figures include those injuries resulting from train accidents, train incidents, and nontrain incidents. Injury figures also include occupational illness. Railroad injury data for 1970 and before are not comparable with post-1970 data due to a change in the reporting system.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i Injuries occurring at highway-rail crossings resulting from freight and passenger rail operations including commuter rail. Highway-rail grade crossing injuries, except train occupants, are also counted under highway. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"j  Includes motor bus, commuter rail, heavy rail, light rail, demand response, van pool, and automated guideway. Transit injuries include those resulting from all reportable incidents, not just from accidents. Directly Operated (DO) modes only. The drop in the number of injuries in 2002 is due largely to a change in definitions by the Federal Transit Administration.  Only injuries requiring immediate medical treatment away from the scene now qualify as reportable.  Previously, any injury was reportable.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
k Injuries occurring at highway-rail crossings resulting from operations of public transit rail modes including commuter rail. Data for injuries at light rail crossings are: 1995 (179); 1996 (171); 1997 (92); 1998 (42); 1999 (148); 2000 (111); 2001 (54); 2002 (76); 2003 (68); 2004 (76). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"l  Vessel-related injuries include those involving damage to vessels, such as collisions or groundings.  Injuries not related to vessel casualties include those from falls overboard or from accidents involving onboard equipment. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"m 1992-97 data come from the Marine Safety Management Information System. Between 1998 and 2001 the U.S. Coast Guard phased in a new computer system to track safety data, the Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement System. During that period data come from combining entries in the Marine Safety Management Information System with entries in the Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement System. Data for 2002, 2003, and 2004 come from the Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement System.  Data for prior years come from other sources and may not be directly comparable. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"n Other than the persons aboard the aircraft who were killed, fatalities resulting from the September 11 terrorist acts are excluded. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The motor vehicle injury data in this table come from the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's General Estimates System (GES).  The data from GES, which began operation in 1988, are obtained from a nationally representative probability sample selected from all police-reported crashes.  The GES sample includes only crashes where a police accident report was completed and the crash resulted in property damage, injury, or death.  The resulting figures do not take into account crashes that were not reported to the police or did not result in property damage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Numbers may not add to total because some injuries are counted in more than one mode.  To avoid double counting, the following adjustments have been made in the total injured row:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most (not all) highway-rail grade crossing injuries have not been added because most (not all) such injuries involve motor vehicles and are already included in highway injuries.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For transit, all commuter rail injuries and motor-bus, trolley-bus, demand-responsive, and van-pool injuries arising from accidents have been subtracted because they are counted as railroad, highway, or highway-rail grade crossing injuries. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The reader cannot reproduce the total injuries count in this table by simply leaving out the number of highway-rail grade crossing injuries in the sum and subtracting the above transit submodes, because in so doing, grade-crossing injuries not involving motor vehicles would be left out (see table 2-35 on rail). An example of such an injury is a bicyclist injured by a train at a grade crossing. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Federal Railroad Administration defines a grade crossing as a location where a public highway, road, street, or private roadway, including associated sidewalks and pathways, crosses one or more railroad tracks at grade. The Federal Transit Administration defines two types of grade crossings: (1) At grade, mixed, and cross traffic crossings, meaning railway right-of-way over which other traffic moving in the same direction or other cross directions may pass. This includes city street right-of-way; (2) At grade with cross traffic crossings, meaning railway right-of-way over which no other traffic may pass, except to cross at grade-level crossings. This can include median strip rights-of-way with grade level crossings at intersecting streets. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
