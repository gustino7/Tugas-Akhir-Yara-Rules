Use care in comparing the data in this table with those in table 3-22.  This table includes weighted part-time employees' salaries. Table 3-22 covers only full-time employees. 1960-85 data are based on the 1972 SIC codes; 1990-98 data are based on the 1987 SIC codes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wage and salary accruals consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips and bonuses; voluntary employee contributions to certain deferred compensation plans, such as 401(k) plans; and receipts in kind that represent income.  In other words, accruals are wage and salary earned, not wage and salary paid. For example, wage and salary earned in 1999 but not paid until 2000 are included in accruals for 1999.  However, the difference between wage and salary earned and wage and salary paid is usually very small.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
