KEY: BAC = blood alcohol content; DWI = driving while intoxicated; Y = yes; N = no; A = alternative; S = suspension; R = revocation; Nms = no mandatory sanction.,,,,,,,,,

"NOTES:  An ""administrative per se law"" allows a state's driver licensing agency to either suspend or revoke a driver's license based on a specific alcohol (or drug) concentration or on some other criterion related to alcohol or drug use and driving.  Such action is independent of any licensing action related to a DWI criminal offense.  The term ""illegal per se"" refers to state laws that make it a criminal offense to operate a motor vehicle at or above a specified alcohol (or drug) concentration in the blood, breath, or urine.  In those columns showing mandatory sanctions, ""nms"" does not mean that a state does not have a sanction.  It only means that the state does not have a mandatory sanction for that offense or violation.",,,,,,,,,
