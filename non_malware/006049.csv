"NOTES: 
Numbers may not add to totals due to rounding.
Data for FY 2000 include only federal government expenditures excluding highway.
Numbers in parenthesis are negative values due to offsetting collections.  Offsetting collections are collections from the public that result from business-type activities and collections from other government accounts, which are deducted from gross outlays and budget authority, rather than combined with government receipts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
